Metaphors are words or phrases that are used to describe something by comparing it to something else. In the play The Tempest, written by William Shakespeare, metaphors are used throughout the story to help the audience understand what is happening in a more creative way. 

In Act 1 of The Tempest, there are several metaphors used to describe the storm that is taking place. One example is when Prospero says, “The sky it seems would pour down stinking pitch”. This metaphor is used to describe how bad the storm is and how dark and gloomy the sky looks. 

Another metaphor used in Act 1 of The Tempest is when Prospero says, “These are not natural events; they strengthen from strange to stranger”. This metaphor is used to describe how strange and unusual the storm is. It's almost as if something supernatural is causing it. 

The last metaphor used in Act 1 of The Tempest is when Ariel says, “I boarded the King’s ship; now on the beak, now in the waist, the deck, in every cabin I flamed amazement”. This metaphor is used to describe how powerful and destructive the storm was. It was so strong that it was able to cause chaos and destruction on board the King's ship. 

Metaphors can be very helpful for young readers because they can help them better understand what is happening in a story. By using metaphors, Shakespeare was able to make his story more interesting and exciting for his audience.</p>
