The Industrial Revolution was a period of time when people started using machines to make things instead of doing it by hand. This revolution changed the way people lived and worked, but it also had an impact on the climate. 

When factories started popping up all over the world, they began burning coal and other fuels to power their machines. Burning these fuels released gases into the air that caused pollution. This pollution made the air dirty and unhealthy for people to breathe. It also created a layer in the atmosphere that traps heat from the sun, which is called the greenhouse effect. 

The greenhouse effect causes temperatures to rise around the world. This means that places that used to be cold are now getting warmer, and places that were already warm are getting even hotter. As temperatures continue to rise, more extreme weather events like hurricanes, floods, and droughts become more common. These events can cause damage to homes, businesses, and crops. 

The Industrial Revolution has had a big impact on our climate and it's important for us to take steps to reduce our emissions so we can help protect our planet for future generations.</p>
